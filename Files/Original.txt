The 1965 Indo-Pak War, also known as the Second Kashmir War, erupted between India and Pakistan over long-standing territorial disputes, particularly centered around the region of Kashmir. The conflict began in April 1965 and lasted until September of the same year. The hostilities were characterized by intense ground battles along the border and in the disputed territory of Kashmir. The war escalated quickly, involving air strikes and naval engagements. International pressure, especially from the United States and the Soviet Union, led to a ceasefire in September 1965, with both sides agreeing to return to pre-war borders. The Tashkent Agreement, brokered by the Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in January 1966, formalized the ceasefire and set the stage for diplomatic efforts to address the underlying issues between the two nations. The war did not result in significant territorial changes but heightened tensions and reinforced the need for diplomatic solutions to the longstanding disputes between India and Pakistan.
